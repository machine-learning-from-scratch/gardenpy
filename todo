# todo list
update README.md (most incomplete)
edit Keras_Drawing.py to utilize the Garden class instead of defining everything at the top of the line
modernize Keras_Drawing.py (add instant evaluations, probability graph on the side, buttons, and ability to immediately save screen)
edit Garden package to have more completed information about usage as well as return types defined near the top
work on CNN and maybe do a CNN from scratch (this will take a long time and will be very slow to train but will be fun and cool)
check to see if anything in the Garden file can be optimized further or restructured to be better
figure out what to do with test files and consider moving all the completed code into another repository
there are more things that should be fixed but i forgot, i'll update this when i remember

update README.md (most incomplete)
edit Keras_Drawing.py to utilize the Garden class instead of defining everything at the top of the line
modernize Keras_Drawing.py (add instant evaluations, probability graph on the side, buttons, and ability to immediately save screen)
edit Garden package to have more completed information about usage as well as return types defined near the top
work on CNN and maybe do a CNN from scratch (this will take a long time and will be very slow to train but will be fun and cool)
check to see if anything in the Garden file can be optimized further or restructured to be better
figure out what to do with test files and consider moving all the completed code into another repository
check if function descriptions are correct
add momentum (a lot of math but will be fun)
update data imports to use pytorch imports instead of keras (will get rid of the stupid warning and be more modernized)
since we'll probably continue to use this repository for more ML stuff, rename git directory to machine-learning-from-scratch (maybe just artificial-intelligence-scratch in the future)
make another github directory called like machine-learning-from-scratch-final which will exclude all of the extra files we have on here
fix mnist display
make data processing effective
i think i messed up the fnn math so i will need to fix it at some point
check fore settings

this is pretty outdated in terms of the actual file naming, so either try interpreting what i meant or wait until i fix this file
this is also just outdated in general since i moved literally everything, i'll update this again once i figure out what i did

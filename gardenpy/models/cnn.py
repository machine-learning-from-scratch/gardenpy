    This model will most likely remain incomplete until the DNN is fully completed.
    This is due to the complexity required to code a CNN from scratch accompanied by a lack of time.
    If in the future, this project is still worked on, this model will see completion.
    However, most likely, only cnn_torch.py will be completed.

# Machine Learning From Scratch
A functional feed-forward model and implementations **without** using fancy libraries that do all of the heavy lifting for you. 

Although some implementations use other packages, the underlying network is functional without packages like pytorch or tensorflow, and instead with purely numpy / math.

The purpose of hard-coding the math from scratch is to illustrate the technical details and statistics / calculus involved in machine learning at the lowest level.
